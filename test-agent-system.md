   - `/api/research/quota` - Check/manage research quotas
   - `/api/research/nft/generate` - Create research NFTs
   - `/api/research/nft/[id]/preview` - NFT metadata
   - `/api/research/nft/[id]/image` - NFT image generation

5. **Enhanced UI**
   - ResearchEnrichment component with rarity styling
   - Integrated research display in ResponseCard
   - NFT minting functionality
   - User tier indicators

## Testing the System

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
Ask an orthopedic question as an authenticated user:
- Question: "What are the best treatments for ACL tears?"
- Expected: Basic Claude response + research enrichment for authenticated users

### 2. Research Synthesis Test
For users with research subscription tiers:
- **Scholar Tier**: Bronze research (5 studies, basic synthesis)
- **Practitioner Tier**: Silver research (8-15 studies, enhanced analysis) 
- **Institution Tier**: Gold research (15-25 studies, comprehensive review)

### 3. NFT Generation Test
Click "Mint NFT" button on research enrichments:
- Generates unique NFT ID
- Creates rarity-based metadata
- Generates SVG image with medical branding
- Simulates blockchain minting process

### 4. Rarity System
Research NFT rarities based on user tier and evidence quality:
- **Bronze**: Basic research, 3-8 studies
- **Silver**: Enhanced research, 8-15 studies  
- **Gold**: MD-ready research, 15-25 studies
- **Platinum**: Multi-MD consensus, 25+ studies

## Revenue Model Integration

### Subscription Tiers
- **Scholar** ($19.99/mo): 5 Bronze, 2 Silver, 0 Gold
- **Practitioner** ($49.99/mo): 10 Bronze, 3 Silver, 1 Gold
- **Institution** ($199/mo): 25 Bronze, 10 Silver, 3 Gold

### NFT Pricing
- **Bronze**: Free creation, $5 MD review
- **Silver**: $2 creation, $10 MD review
- **Gold**: $5 creation, $15 MD review  
- **Platinum**: $10 creation, $25 MD review

## Next Steps for Production

1. **PubMed API Integration**
   - Replace simulated research with real PubMed queries
   - Implement proper paper ranking and filtering
   - Add citation analysis and impact factors

2. **Blockchain Integration** 
   - Deploy NFT contract on Base network
   - Implement actual IPFS metadata storage
   - Add wallet connection and minting transactions

3. **Advanced Agent Features**
   - Medical image analysis agent
   - Treatment plan generator agent
   - Clinical trial matching agent
   - Drug interaction checker agent

4. **Premium Features**
   - Real-time MD chat integration
   - Custom research report generation
   - Institutional bulk processing
   - API access for third-party developers

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Scalable Agent System**: Easy to add new agents without core changes
2. **Tiered Value Delivery**: Different research depth based on subscription
3. **NFT Collectibility**: Creates user engagement and retention
4. **Revenue Multiplication**: Single research can generate subscription + NFT + MD review revenue
5. **Training Data Quality**: Agent interactions provide high-quality fine-tuning data

## Competitive Advantages

- **Only MD-verified AI**: Systematic medical professional review
- **Research NFT Marketplace**: Portable, tradeable medical knowledge
- **Agentic Automation**: Proactive vs reactive healthcare insights
- **Web3 Native**: Blockchain-verified medical credentials
- **Educational Focus**: Maintains legal safety while providing value

The system is now ready for user testing and can be expanded with additional agents and blockchain integration as needed.

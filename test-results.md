# Rate Limiting Test Results

## Test Plan Implementation Results

### âœ… Changes Made:

1. **Updated UserTier System**:
   - Changed from `'anonymous' | 'authenticated' | 'medical'` to `'basic' | 'authenticated' | 'medical'`
   - Updated rate limits: basic: 1, authenticated: 3, medical: 10 questions per day

2. **Fixed User Identification**:
   - Removed all `|| 'anonymous'` fallbacks
   - Now always uses `context.user.fid` from Farcaster SDK
   - Each user tracked by their unique Farcaster FID

3. **Enabled View Artwork for All Users**:
   - Removed authentication check from ActionMenu
   - All Farcaster users (basic, authenticated, medical) can view artwork

4. **Updated UI Labels**:
   - Changed "Anonymous" to "Basic User" with blue badge and ðŸ‘¤ icon
   - Maintained "Authenticated" badge for Quick Auth users

5. **Updated API Error Messages**:
   - Enhanced rate limit messages with encouragement to return tomorrow
   - Added upgrade messaging for basic users to sign in for more questions

### âœ… Benefits Achieved:

- **Individual Rate Limiting**: Each user now has their own rate limit tracked by FID
- **Proper Question Count**: Question count will decrease correctly per user
- **Better User Experience**: All Farcaster users can access artwork feature
- **Clear Upgrade Path**: Basic (1) â†’ Authenticated (3) â†’ Medical (10)

### ðŸ§ª Ready for Testing:

The application is now ready to test the following scenarios:

1. **Basic User Flow**:
   - User loads mini app â†’ sees "Basic User" badge
   - Shows "1 of 1" questions remaining
   - Can submit question â†’ count decreases to "0 of 1"
   - Second question attempt â†’ blocked with encouraging message
   - Can access "View Artwork" button

2. **Authentication Upgrade**:
   - Click "Sign in with Farcaster" â†’ complete Quick Auth
   - Badge changes to "Authenticated"
   - Question limit increases to "3 of 3"
   - Can submit up to 3 questions total

3. **Rate Limit Enforcement**:
   - Questions properly tracked per individual FID
   - 24-hour reset timer shown when limit reached
   - Encouraging messages when limits are hit

The implementation should now resolve the original issue where question counts weren't decreasing due to all users sharing the same 'anonymous' identifier.

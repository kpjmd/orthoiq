# Database-Based Rate Limiting Implementation

## âœ… Problem Solved

**Issue**: Question count wasn't decreasing because the in-memory Map was resetting with each serverless function cold start.

**Solution**: Implemented database-based rate limiting that persists across serverless function invocations.

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced Database Functions** (`lib/database.ts`)

Added two new functions:

- **`checkRateLimitDBWithTiers(fid, tier)`**: 
  - Queries the questions table for count in last 24 hours
  - Supports all user tiers (basic: 1, authenticated: 3, medical: 10)
  - Returns allowed status, remaining count, and reset time
  - Works per individual FID

- **`getRateLimitStatusDB(fid, tier)`**:
  - Gets current question count without incrementing
  - Same format as in-memory version for compatibility
  - Used by frontend to display remaining questions

### 2. **Updated API Routes**

- **`/api/claude`**: Now uses `checkRateLimitDBWithTiers` instead of in-memory `checkRateLimit`
- **`/api/rate-limit-status`**: Now uses `getRateLimitStatusDB` for consistent database queries

### 3. **Database Query Logic**

Both functions use the same SQL query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM questions 
WHERE fid = ${fid} AND created_at > ${oneDayAgo.toISOString()}
```

This counts all questions submitted by a specific FID in the last 24 hours.

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

### Before (Broken):
- Question count always showed max (3/3 or 1/1)
- Users could submit unlimited questions
- Rate limits never enforced due to serverless resets

### After (Fixed):
- Question count decreases properly after each submission
- Each user tracked individually by their Farcaster FID  
- Rate limits enforced across serverless function invocations
- Database persistence ensures accuracy

## ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios

### Basic User (Tier: basic, Limit: 1)
1. Load mini app â†’ shows "1 of 1" questions remaining
2. Submit question â†’ count decreases to "0 of 1"
3. Try second question â†’ blocked with "Daily limit reached!" message
4. Message encourages signing in for more questions

### Authenticated User (Tier: authenticated, Limit: 3)
1. Sign in with Farcaster â†’ shows "3 of 3" questions remaining
2. Submit question â†’ count decreases to "2 of 3"
3. Submit second question â†’ count decreases to "1 of 3"
4. Submit third question â†’ count decreases to "0 of 3"
5. Try fourth question â†’ blocked with reset timer

### Multi-User Testing
- Each FID gets their own independent rate limit
- User A can't exhaust User B's questions
- Database queries are scoped by FID

## ðŸ”„ Benefits

1. **Persistent Storage**: Rate limits survive serverless cold starts
2. **Individual Tracking**: Each user gets their own question count
3. **Accurate Counting**: Database ensures consistency
4. **Production Ready**: Works on Vercel and other serverless platforms
5. **Fallback Safety**: Defaults to allowing questions on database errors

## ðŸ“Š Database Impact

- Queries the existing `questions` table
- No schema changes required
- Uses existing `fid` and `created_at` columns
- Consider adding index on `(fid, created_at)` for performance if needed

The implementation now provides reliable, persistent rate limiting that will correctly decrease question counts for each individual user.
